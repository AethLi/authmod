## General
AuthMod is a mod allowing you to accept players playing with the Minecraft demo (players who have not paid for the game) safely.

## Operation

At each new connection to the server, the mod will ask the new player to enter a password. This password must be entered in order to play. Otherwise, the player will be unable to play and kicked after a while.
